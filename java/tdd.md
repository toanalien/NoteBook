**Test-driven development** is based on writing the application tests before the
main code logic, making these tests fail first, and then writing the code to
make them pass.

**WHY IS TDD GOOD FOR DEVELOPERS?**

There are many reasons why, but the most important one is that TDD forces (bắt buộc) you and the business person to think about the prerequisites (tiên quyết) in a deeper way (một cách sâu sắc hơn). This includes thinking about what the code should do under certain situations (tình huống nhất định) or use cases. It will help you clarify (làm rõ) vague (mơ hồ) prerequisites and reject invalid ones (từ chối những điều không hợp lệ). 

However (tuy nhiên), there is one idea usually associated with (liên kết với) TDD that sometimes is taken to the extreme (cực đoạn): continuous refactoring (tái cấu trúc liên tục) of code in several iterations.

You should find a balance (cân bằng) — it’s not a good idea to write poor quality, unmaintainable (không thể nhầm lẫn??) code just to make the tests pass and then later refactor them.
