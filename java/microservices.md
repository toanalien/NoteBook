## How Is This Book Different from Other Books and Guides?

### Reasoning Behind the Techniques (Lập luận đằng sau các kĩ thuật)

Software developers and architects read many technical books and guides, either because we’re interested in learning new technologies or just because we need it for our work. We need to do that anyway since it’s a constantly-changing (thay đổi liên tục) world. We can find all kinds of books and guides out there (ngoài đó). Good ones are usually those from which you learn quickly, and ones that teach you not only how to do stuff, but also why you should do it that way (tại sao bạn làm theo cách đó). Using new techniques (những kĩ thuật) just because they’re new is the wrong way to go (đi sai đường) about it; you need to understand the reasoning behind them so you use them in the best way possible (cách tốt nhất có thể).

This book uses that philosophy (triết lý): it navigates (điều hướng) through (thông qua) the code and design patterns (mẫu thiết kế), explaining (giải thích) the reasons to follow one way and not others.

### Learning: An Incremental Process (Một quá trình tăng dần)

If you look at the guides available on the Internet, you’ll notice quickly that they are not real-life (không thực tế) examples. Usually (thông thường), when you apply those cases to more complex scenarios (tình huống phức tạp), they don’t fit (không phù hợp). Guides are too shallow (nông) to help you building something real.

Books, on the other hand (mặc khác), are much better at that. There are plenty of (có rất nhiều) good books explaining concepts (giải thích khái niệm) around an example; they are good because applying theoretical (lý thuyết) concepts to code is not always easy if you don’t see the code. The problem with some of these books is that they’re not as practical as guides (thực tế như hướng dẫn). You need to read them first to understand the concepts, then code (or see) the example, which is frequently (thường xuyên) given as a whole piece (toàn bộ). It’s difficult to put into practice concepts when you see the final version directly. This book stays on the practical side and starts with code that evolves through (tiến hoá thông qua) refactoring (tái cấu trúc), so the concepts are understood (hiểu) step-by-step. We cover the problem before exposing (đưa ra) the solutions.

Because of this incremental way of presenting concepts, this book also allows you to code as you learn and to reflect on (suy ngẫm về) the challenges by yourself.

### Is This a Guide or a Book?

The pages you have in front of (ở đằng trước) you can’t be called a guide: it won’t take you 15 or 30 minutes to finish them. But this is not the typical book either, in which you go through concepts illustrated (được minh hoạ) with some code fragments. Instead, you start with a version of the code that is not yet optimal, and you learn how to evolve it, after learning about the benefits you can extract from that process.

That does not mean that you can’t just sit down and read it, but it’s better if you code at the same time and play with the options and alternatives presented (cách trình bày khác). That’s the part of the book that makes it similar to a guide.

In any case (Trong mọi trường hợp), to keep it simple, from here onward (từ đây trở đi) we call this a book.
